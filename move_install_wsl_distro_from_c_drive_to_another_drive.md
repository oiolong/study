I have a small 128GB SSD. I run out of space when I install ReactNative related dev tools. So I wanted to find a way to install/move my existing distro to different location than C drive.

Move WSL to another drive
- Install LxRunOffline tool. 


```

choco install lxrunoffline

```

- List all wsls


```

lxrunoffline list 

```


List all the installed distros on your system. I get output like this.
